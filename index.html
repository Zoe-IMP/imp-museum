		<div>Did You Know?EndFragment</div>
		<div>Arthur J. Wasley and Frank Faniola form Plainville Metal Works after leaving National Marine Lamp Co. Their first light, built in Art’s basement, sparks a legacy of craftsmanship and courage.

		<div>1926 • FOUNDING & WAR EFFORT
</div>
		<div>The First Team</div>
		<div>Plainville Metal Works hires its first employees, David Sneiderman and Joseph LeFemmine. 
Both remained with the company for decades, laying the foundation for a culture of loyalty and skill.

EndFragment</div>
		<div>1929 • FOUNDING & WAR EFFORT
</div>
		<div>Sneiderman earned $10 a week when he started and stayed 25 years. LeFemmine stayed 43, helping build every lighting product line from scratch.

EndFragment</div>
		<div>A Sole Vision</div>
		<div>Following Frank Faniola’s passing, Art Wasley becomes sole proprietor and relocates to Farmington Avenue. The company expands into hospital products, postal scales, and household goods, adapting to survive the Depression.

EndFragment</div>
		<div>1935 • FOUNDING & WAR EFFORT
</div>
		<div>When times were tough, the Wasley family worked together to keep things afloat. Lola Wasley ran the books while their teenage son Justin (“Jut”) learned toolmaking after school.

EndFragment</div>
		<div>War Production: The Ripcord Miracle</div>
		<div>When metal shortages ended civilian production during WWII, Art pivoted to military contracts. Without blueprints or specs, he promised a parachute manufacturer 100,000 ripcord assemblies and delivered. Working nights with his son Jut, he tooled every piece himself. 
By war’s end, Wasley Products had produced over two million ripcords and countless other aircraft parts. It transformed a local lighting shop into a national defense manufacturer, proof that innovation thrives under pressure.

EndFragment</div>
		<div>Toolmakers were so essential to the war effort that Jut Wasley was officially exempted from service so he could keep producing critical parts at home.

		<div>1955 • EXPANSION & DIVERSIFICATION
</div>
		<div>In August 1955, the Pequabuck River rose overnight and swallowed the Farmington plant up to the second floor. Machinery, inventory, and records vanished under muddy water. Damage exceeded the company’s total worth. 
Instead of giving up, every employee helped rebuild. Within months, production restarted, and by 1959 a new two-story office stood on the same site, stronger than before. The flood became a story of Wasley resilience: when the river rose, so did they.

EndFragment</div>
		<div>The Great Flood</div>
		<div>Without records, Art wrote every supplier asking for duplicate invoices and trusted them to be honest about what they were owed. Every one was.

EndFragment</div>
		<div>A late-1950s advertisement used a pin-up inspired aesthetic next to a Wasley lighting fixture. The image reflects the era’s fascination with glamour, theatricality, and eye-catching design in print advertising.

</div>
		<div>When a friend at Zimmer-Bailey needed a surgical positioning device fast, Alan Wasley and James Bailey built it themselves. The McGuire Pelvic Positioner became the foundation of Innovative Medical Products (IMP), combining engineering precision with medical compassion.
From one urgent prototype, IMP grew into a leader in orthopedic positioning, partnering with surgeons worldwide and transforming patient care.

The story went national: a Connecticut manufacturer known for ripcords had saved America’s favorite roller coaster. From wartime parachutes to theme park thrills, Wasley ingenuity came full circle.

EndFragment</div>
		<div>Decades after WWII, Wasley once again supported U.S. forces, producing Teflon and Viton seals for Apache helicopters, HUMVs, and jet fighters during Operation Desert Storm.
